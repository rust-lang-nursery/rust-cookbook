## Convert date to UNIX timestamp and vice versa
[![chrono-badge]][chrono] [![cat-date-and-time-badge]][cat-date-and-time]

Converts a date given by [`NaiveDate::from_ymd`] and [`NaiveTime::from_hms`]
to [UNIX timestamp] using [`NaiveDateTime::timestamp`].
Then it calculates what was the date after one billion seconds
since January 1, 1970 0:00:00 UTC, using [`NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp`].

```rust,edition2018
use chrono::{NaiveDate, NaiveDateTime};

fn main() {
    let date_time: NaiveDateTime = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2017, 11, 12).and_hms(17, 33, 44);
    println!(
        "Number of seconds between 1970-01-01 00:00:00 and {} is {}.",
        date_time, date_time.timestamp());

    let date_time_after_a_billion_seconds = NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp(1_000_000_000, 0);
    println!(
        "Date after a billion seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 was {}.",
        date_time_after_a_billion_seconds);
}
```
