### Standard deviation

[![std-badge]][std]

This example calculates the standard deviation and z-score of a set of measurements.

The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance (here calculated with f32's [`sqrt`], where the variance is the [`sum`] of the squared difference between each measurement and the [`mean`], divided by the number of measurements.

The z-score is the number of standard deviations a single measurement spans away from the [`mean`] of the data set.


```rust
fn mean(data: &[i32]) -> Option<f32> {
    let sum = data.iter().sum::<i32>() as f32;
    let count = data.len();

    match count {
        positive if positive > 0 => Some(sum / count as f32),
        _ => None,
    }
}

fn std_deviation(data: &[i32]) -> Option<f32> {
    match (mean(data), data.len()) {
        (Some(data_mean), count) if count > 0 => {
            let variance = data.iter().map(|value| {
                let diff = data_mean - (*value as f32);

                diff * diff
            }).sum::<f32>() / count as f32;

            Some(variance.sqrt())
        },
        _ => None
    }
}

fn main() {
    let data = [3, 1, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 10, 11];

    let data_mean = mean(&data);
    println!("Mean is {:?}", data_mean);

    let data_std_deviation = std_deviation(&data);
    println!("Standard deviation is {:?}", data_std_deviation);

    let zscore = match (data_mean, data_std_deviation) {
        (Some(mean), Some(std_deviation)) => {
            let diff = data[4] as f32 - mean;

            Some(diff / std_deviation)
        },
        _ => None
    };
    println!("Z-score of data at index 4 (with value {}) is {:?}", data[4], zscore);
}
```
