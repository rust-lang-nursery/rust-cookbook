## Adding matrices
[![ndarray-badge]][ndarray] [![cat-science-badge]][cat-science]

Creates two 2-D matrices with [`ndarray::arr2`] and sums them element-wise.

Note the sum is computed as `let sum = &a + &b`. The `&` operator is used to avoid consuming `a` and `b`, making them available later for display. A new array is created containing their sum.

```rust,edition2018

use ndarray::arr2;

fn main() {
    let a = arr2(&[[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]]);

    let b = arr2(&[[6, 5, 4],
                   [3, 2, 1]]);

    let sum = &a + &b;

    println!("{}", a);
    println!("+");
    println!("{}", b);
    println!("=");
    println!("{}", sum);
}
```
