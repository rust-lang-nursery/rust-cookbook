## Vector norm
[![ndarray-badge]][ndarray]

This recipe demonstrates use of the [`Array1`] type, [`ArrayView1`] type,
[`fold`] method, and [`dot`] method in computing the [l1] and [l2] norms of a
given vector. 
+ The `l2_norm` function is the simpler of the two, as it computes the
square root of the dot product of a vector with itself.
+ The `l1_norm` function is computed by a `fold`
operation that sums the absolute values of the elements. (This could also be
performed with `x.mapv(f64::abs).scalar_sum()`, but that would allocate a new
array for the result of the `mapv`.)

Note that both `l1_norm` and `l2_norm` take the [`ArrayView1`] type. This recipe
considers vector norms, so the norm functions only need to accept one-dimensional 
views (hence [`ArrayView1`]). While the functions could take a
parameter of type `&Array1<f64>` instead, that would require the caller to have
a reference to an owned array, which is more restrictive than just having access
to a view (since a view can be created from any array or view, not just an owned
array).

`Array` and `ArrayView` are both type aliases for `ArrayBase`. So, the most 
general argument type for the caller would be `&ArrayBase<S, Ix1> where S: Data`, 
because then the caller could use `&array` or `&view` instead of `x.view()`. 
If the function is part of a public API, that may be a better choice for the 
benefit of users. For internal functions, the more concise `ArrayView1<f64>` 
may be preferable.

```rust,edition2018

use ndarray::{array, Array1, ArrayView1};

fn l1_norm(x: ArrayView1<f64>) -> f64 {
    x.fold(0., |acc, elem| acc + elem.abs())
}

fn l2_norm(x: ArrayView1<f64>) -> f64 {
    x.dot(&x).sqrt()
}

fn normalize(mut x: Array1<f64>) -> Array1<f64> {
    let norm = l2_norm(x.view());
    x.mapv_inplace(|e| e/norm);
    x
}

fn main() {
    let x = array![1., 2., 3., 4., 5.];
    println!("||x||_2 = {}", l2_norm(x.view()));
    println!("||x||_1 = {}", l1_norm(x.view()));
    println!("Normalizing x yields {:?}", normalize(x));
}
```
