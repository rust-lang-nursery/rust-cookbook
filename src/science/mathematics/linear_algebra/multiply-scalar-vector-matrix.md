## Multiply a scalar with a vector with a matrix
[![ndarray-badge]][ndarray] [![cat-science-badge]][cat-science]

Creates a 1-D array (vector) with [`ndarray::arr1`] and a 2-D array (matrix)
with [`ndarray::arr2`]. First, a scalar is multiplied by the vector to get
another vector. Then, the matrix is multiplied by the new vector with [`dot`].
([`dot`] performs matrix multiplication, while the `*` operator performs
element-wise multiplication.) In `ndarray`, 1-D arrays can be interpreted as
either row or column vectors depending on context. If representing the
orientation of a vector is important, a 2-D array with one row or one column
must be used instead. In this example, the vector is a 1-D array on the
right-hand side, so [`dot`] handles it as a column vector.

```rust
extern crate ndarray;

use ndarray::{arr1, arr2, Array1};

fn main() {
    let scalar = 4;

    let vector = arr1(&[1, 2, 3]);

    let matrix = arr2(&[[4, 5, 6],
                        [7, 8, 9]]);

    let new_vector: Array1<_> = scalar * vector;
    println!("{}", new_vector);

    let new_matrix = matrix.dot(&new_vector);
    println!("{}", new_matrix);
}
```
