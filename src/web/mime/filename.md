## Get MIME type from filename

[![mime-badge]][mime] [![cat-encoding-badge]][cat-encoding]

The following example shows how to return the correct MIME type from a given
filename using the [mime] crate.  The program will check for file extensions
and match against a known list.  The return value is [`mime:Mime`].

```rust,edition2018
use mime::Mime;

fn find_mimetype (filename : &String) -> Mime{

    let parts : Vec<&str> = filename.split('.').collect();

    let res = match parts.last() {
            Some(v) =>
                match *v {
                    "png" => mime::IMAGE_PNG,
                    "jpg" => mime::IMAGE_JPEG,
                    "json" => mime::APPLICATION_JSON,
                    &_ => mime::TEXT_PLAIN,
                },
            None => mime::TEXT_PLAIN,
        };
    return res;
}

fn main() {
    let filenames = vec!("foobar.jpg", "foo.bar", "foobar.png");
    for file in filenames {
	    let mime = find_mimetype(&file.to_owned());
	 	println!("MIME for {}: {}", file, mime);
	 }

}
```
