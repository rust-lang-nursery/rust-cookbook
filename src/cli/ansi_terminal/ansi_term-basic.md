## ANSI Terminal

[![ansi_term-badge]][ansi_term] [![cat-command-line-badge]][cat-command-line]

This program depicts the use of [`ansi_term`] crate and how it is used for controlling colours and formatting, such as blue bold text or yellow underlined text, on ANSI terminals.

There are two main data structures in [`ansi_term`]: [`ANSIString`] and [`Style`]. A [`Style`] holds stylistic information: colours, whether the text should be bold, or blinking, or whatever. There are also Colour variants that represent simple foreground colour styles. An [`ANSIString`] is a string paired with a [`Style`].

**Note:** British English uses *Colour* instead of *Color*, don't get confused

### Printing colored text to the Terminal

```rust,edition2018
use ansi_term::Colour;

fn main() {
    println!("This is {} in color, {} in color and {} in color",
             Colour::Red.paint("red"),
             Colour::Blue.paint("blue"),
             Colour::Green.paint("green"));
}
```

### Bold text in Terminal

For anything more complex than plain foreground colour changes, the code
needs to construct `Style` struct. [`Style::new()`] creates the struct,
and properties chained.

```rust,edition2018
use ansi_term::Style;

fn main() {
    println!("{} and this is not",
             Style::new().bold().paint("This is Bold"));
}
```
### Bold and colored text in terminal

`Colour` implements many similar functions as `Style` and can chain methods.

```rust,edition2018
use ansi_term::Colour;
use ansi_term::Style;

fn main(){
    println!("{}, {} and {}",
             Colour::Yellow.paint("This is colored"),
             Style::new().bold().paint("this is bold"),
             Colour::Yellow.bold().paint("this is bold and colored"));
}
```
