This _Rust Cookbook_ is a collection of simple [Rust] examples that
demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks,
using the crates of the Rust ecosystem.

These examples are complete, and suitable for copying directly into
new cargo projects. They are tested and guaranteed to work.
